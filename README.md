**Title:**
Navigating Fairness in LLM: A Comprehensive Literature Review on Integrating Personality Profiling for Enhanced Music and Movie Recommendations

**Abstract:**
The rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has heightened concerns about fairness and accuracy. This paper delves into the incorporation of personality profiling to augment precision and impartiality in LLM-based music and movie recommendations. Through an in-depth literature review, we uncover current research frontiers, pinpoint gaps, and propose future directions. This analysis is a crucial resource for stakeholders aiming to utilize personality profiling for equitable recommendations in LLM-based systems, fostering a more engaging and personalized user experience.

**Introduction:**
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our research paper, "Navigating Fairness in LLM." The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI's GPT-3 and Google's LaMDA, has revolutionized natural language processing, particularly in developing advanced recommendation systems. These models excel in generating creative text, facilitating language translation, and engaging in human-like conversations. Our focus lies in harnessing the potential of LLMs to enhance the accuracy and personalization of music and movie recommendations.

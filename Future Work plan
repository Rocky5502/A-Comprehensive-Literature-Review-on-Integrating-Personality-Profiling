**Future Work Plan: Enhancing Fairness in LLM-Based Recommender Systems**

This section outlines the planned future work based on the identified research questions:

**RQ1: Developing a Comprehensive Fairness Evaluation Framework**
Our future work will focus on designing and proposing a robust framework to enhance the fairness evaluation process in Large Language Model (LLM)-based music and movie recommendation systems. We aim to delve deeper into refining existing evaluation metrics and incorporating novel indicators to ensure a comprehensive and nuanced assessment of fairness.

**RQ2: Enhancing LLMs through Personality Profiling**
Building upon the insights gained from our research, the next phase involves investigating strategies to improve the fairness of LLMs in music and movie recommendations. Specifically, we will explore the integration of personality profiling techniques to tailor recommendations based on individual user traits. This involves refining existing algorithms and experimenting with innovative approaches to maximize fairness in the recommendations provided by LLMs.

**RQ3: Addressing Open Challenges and Charting Future Directions**
Our ongoing commitment extends to identifying and addressing open challenges in the domain of fairness in LLM-based recommender systems. We will conduct a thorough exploration of the current landscape, highlighting challenges faced by existing models and methodologies. Additionally, we will propose avenues for future research, aiming to guide scholars and practitioners toward novel solutions and advancements in this rapidly evolving field.

**Key Objectives:**
1. Develop a detailed fairness evaluation framework for LLM-based recommendation systems.
2. Investigate and implement strategies to integrate personality profiling for enhanced fairness in LLMs.
3. Identify and address open challenges in the field, providing insights for future research.
4. Foster collaboration and engagement within the research community to collectively advance the understanding and implementation of fairness in recommendation systems.

This future work plan aims to contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on fairness in LLM-based recommender systems, paving the way for more inclusive and personalized user experiences.
